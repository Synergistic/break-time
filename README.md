break-time
==========

Break/work timer

First major Kivy application. It is designed to set off an alarm
after the specified duration(s). It helps to monitor how long
you've been sitting in a chair or if you should be running BACK
to your chair. It has the ability to turn the alarm on/off, pause,
and reset. It's just reached a functional level so there's a lot 
more work to do.

  - Exception handling
  - Bug testing
  - Proper alarm sound
  - Ability to change alarm sound?
  - Figure out how to get it packaged for various platforms
